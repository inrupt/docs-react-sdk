App Generator
============

The easiest way to get started with the `Solid React SDK <https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react>`_ 
is by using the `Next.js application generator <https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app>`_. 
This simple CLI tool together with our `Solid React Example Application <https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react-example-project>`_ 
enables you to quickly start building a new Solid `Next.js <https://nextjs.org>`_ application, 
with everything set up for you. To get started, use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react-example-project

This will generate the Solid React Example Application project with all the necessary dependencies.
To run locally:

.. code-block:: sh
  
  npm run dev
    # or
  yarn dev

If you already have a React application and what to manuall add the Solid React SDK Components 
to it, have a look at the :doc:`/installation` instructions.
